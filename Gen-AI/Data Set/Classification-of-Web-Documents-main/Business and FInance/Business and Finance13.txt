Title: Stock market today: US stocks drop as investors digest first batch of bank earnings
US stocks dropped on Friday as investors digested the first batch of first-quarter earnings with the major banks reporting results.JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup all reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, though the beats weren't too impressive as shares of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo declined while Citigroup stock jumped about half of a percent. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that while the stock market is in a happy place and most economic indicators look favorable, there are still sizable risks that could arise at any time."Looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces. First, the global landscape is unsettling, terrible wars and violence continue to cause suffering, and geopolitical tensions are growing. Second, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue," Dimon said.On the inflation front, US import prices rose for the third month in a row in March, slightly above consensus estimates at 0.4% month-over-month. Nearly all of the increase in import prices has been driven by the recent surge in oil prices.Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Friday: Here's what else is going on today: In commodities, bonds, and crypto:
