Title: Brazilian Carrot Cake
In my country of Brazil, or carrot cake, is a staple. For a lot of kids, it’s their first contact with a vegetable, especially for the picky eaters. It’s also something you take in your lunch box to school. A fun fact about Brazilian cakes is that most times the recipes are done in the blender. Kitchen gadgets are very expensive in my country, and most households only have the basics, which makes everything easier. My favorite way to enjoy this is with a glass of cold whole milk on the side, but my fellow countryman would also say it pairs perfectly with a fresh cup of coffee. So if you’re looking for a different approach to carrot cake, here it is. You don’t need to grate any carrots for this cake! The carrots are peeled, sliced, and then thrown in a blender with the rest of the ingredients and pureed until smooth. Chocolate sauce is even better than cream cheese frosting. Pairing the carrot cake with a chocolate sauce rather than a cream cheese frosting means it isn’t too sweet, making it the perfect afternoon snack.
