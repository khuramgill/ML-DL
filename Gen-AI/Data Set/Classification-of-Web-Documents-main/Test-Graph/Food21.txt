Title: Incredible Gochujang Sauce
Mix up your sauce ingredients. Love a one-step recipe. Use it to dip, dunk, drizzle, spread, swoop, and/or all of the above. Here is a picture of this gochujang sauce on a kale and cabbage salad with air fryer chicken on top. Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste and adjust! I usually add a small pinch of salt because I love salt. You can also thin it out with a tablespoon of water so more of a drizzle if that’s what you’re going for! Serve as a dip with grilled or air-fried chicken, a dressing for a creamy slaw, a spread on a burger – whatever floats your boat. It’s all so delicious. This gochujang sauce will keep for about a week in the fridge! She does well as a make-ahead option! Things I have used this sauce on: a dip for air fryer chicken (this was the OG, which naturally leads to…) a dip for air fryer tofu! and a dip for the air fryer salmon! a smashburger! a salad dressing! a sauce on a rice bowl! a drizzle for a wrap or sandwich!
