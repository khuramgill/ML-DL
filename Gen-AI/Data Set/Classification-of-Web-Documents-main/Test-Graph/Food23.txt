Title: Biscuits And Gravy Egg Bake
Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake! YES! A casserole-style dish of fluffy eggs and cheddar baked up with little bites of tender flaky biscuit pieces, and buried under a blanket of creamy green chile sausage gravy. Cook the Sausage: Brown the sausage in a large cast iron skillet. Remove from pan. Drain off excess grease. Make the Gravy: Melt butter in the same cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour; stir until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Whisk in the milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, until a smooth gravy comes together. Add salt, diced green chiles, and sausage back to the gravy. Stir to combine. Whisk the Eggs: In a separate bowl, whisk eggs with milk and salt. Assemble the Egg Bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place half of the biscuits over the bottom of a greased 9×13 pan. Pour eggs over top. Sprinkle with cheese and dollop with some of the gravy (but save some gravy for later). Arrange with remaining biscuits. Bake for 35 minutes, until eggs are set. Eat Up: Serve slices warm from the oven, with a scoop of that green chile sausage gravy over the top (thin it out with a little more milk so it’s semi-pourable, since it usually thickens as it cools).
