Final: The Financial Implications of Using AI in Marketing
When startup funding is tight, marketing can feel like a luxury—even if it isn’t. Fortunately for founders, relevant technologies driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can amplify the efforts of a small marketing team. In fact, according to a Bain & Company survey of nearly 600 companies in 11 industries, almost 40% of respondents said they’re already using or considering using generative AI to speed the development of marketing collateral. And a majority of global business leaders expect a rapid adoption of AI-powered marketing tools in the next two years, with 90% of those surveyed by McKinsey & Company anticipating frequent use of generative AI. One reason for this quick adoption is that marketing is characterized by a convergence of creative and data-driven tasks—a combination that makes this area a prime target for disruption by generative AI. As a digital marketing specialist who works with startups, established businesses, and thought leaders to expand reach and grow sales on limited budgets, I have found AI to be crucial to the services I provide. It enables startups in particular to perform essential marketing tasks, such as web analytics, search engine optimization, and email outreach, speedily and at significantly lower costs at a time when scarce funding is making many projects otherwise difficult or impossible. As companies integrate AI tools into their marketing functions, one major challenge is picking the right solution for their specific needs. The dizzying pace and variety of today’s AI offerings have even the most tech-savvy business owners racing to keep up. Take ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot by OpenAI that can perform data analysis, content generation, and other marketing-related tasks. It’s been in the public domain for barely a year but it already has more than 1.7 billion users. And it’s just one of many new AI tools and platforms being rolled out and regularly updated in a race among the world’s biggest tech companies to stay ahead.
